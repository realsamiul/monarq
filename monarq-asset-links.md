## STEP-BY-STEP FOR iOS PERPLEXITY APP

### Download a Photo:

1. **Copy link from table above** → Paste into browser
2. **Tap image when page loads** → Click Download button
3. **Select "Download Free"** (Unsplash) or highest resolution
4. **Hold on image** → Select "Save Image"
5. **Rename later**: Connect to computer, batch rename files to match "Correct Filename" column

### Download Multiple at Once:

**Pro tip**: Tap link, wait for image to load in browser, then:
- iOS: Open in background tabs
- After you close app, transfer all to computer
- Use bulk rename tool (Bulk Rename Utility on Windows, Automator on Mac)

---

## RECOMMENDED BULK RENAME TOOL

**Windows**: [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) (free, portable)
**Mac**: Built-in Automator or [A-Zippr](https://a-zippr.com/)
**Online**: [Rename.onl](https://rename.onl/) (browser-based, no installation)

### Quick Rename Example:
```
Downloaded filename: unsplash-8347834.jpg
Rename to: belief-banner.jpg
Placed in: assets/img/belief-banner.jpg
```

---

## SUMMARY - WHAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD NOW

✅ **16 photo assets** ready for immediate download from Unsplash/Pexels
⚠️ **4 assets** requiring specific photo selection from search results
❌ **25 assets** requiring custom creation (diagrams, renders, composites, headshots)

**Total time to download 16 photos on iOS**: ~5-10 minutes
**Total time to create 25 custom assets**: ~4-8 hours (depending on tools/skills)

---

## ALTERNATIVE: Python Download Script

If you want to download the 16 available photos to your computer later automatically, use this Python script:

```python
import requests
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Create directory structure
os.makedirs('assets/img', exist_ok=True)

downloads = {
    'belief-banner.jpg': 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=2000&q=80',
    'apes-1.jpg': 'https://unsplash.com/napi/users/krakenimages/photos',  # requires selection
    'services-2.jpg': 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517694712202-14dd9538aa97?w=2000&q=80',
    # ... add more as URLs are confirmed
}

for filename, url in downloads.items():
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(f'assets/img/{filename}', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print(f'Downloaded: {filename}')
```

Run this later on your computer when you have the specific URLs.
