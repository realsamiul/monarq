ROLE: You are a Senior Visual Asset Researcher for a high-end digital agency.
PROJECT: M0NARQ AI, a website with a "cinematic tech" and "premium minimalist" aesthetic.
OBJECTIVE: Find high-resolution, high-quality, royalty-free images (from sources like Unsplash, Pexels, NASA, Wikimedia Commons, etc.) that precisely match the creative brief for each asset listed below. The aesthetic is dark, moody, and professional, with cinematic lighting and a focus on technology, physics, and data.
DELIVERABLES:
For each asset, you must provide:
 * Direct Download URL: A direct link to the high-resolution image file (e.g., a .jpg or .png).
 * Image Source Page: The URL of the page where the image can be found (e.g., the Unsplash page).
 * Notes: A brief confirmation of how it matches the description.
CONSTRAINTS:
 * All images must be high-resolution (minimum 2000px on the longest side).
 * All images must match the specified Ratio.
 * No paid or watermarked stock photos. Use only CCO, Public Domain, or similar "free to use" licenses.
 * For "Avatars," provide generic, professional, and diverse headshots that fit the role.
 * The File Path is for ID only; you do not need to use it.
 * Format your entire response as a single, complete Markdown table.
